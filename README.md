# image-sorter-tif
this program will be used by the user to load .tif files from the folder of his choice. The user will have full control over the image file. After viewing the document, you will be able to choose where the image will be transferred to one of the 3 folders using the buttons.


Currently image moving to another folder isn't working, Im trying my best to fix this :)
